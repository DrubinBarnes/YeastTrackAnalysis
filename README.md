# YeastTrackAnalysis
Joh's code to automate Yidi's yeast CME track analysis
Started in 2018


For Yidi:
To download the newest Version into your folder, do this:

- open the Terminal
- go to the folder where this readme is in:

- type: cd /Users/sun.hong/Desktop/YeastTrackAnalysis-master/YeastTrackAnalysis

- download the newest version by typing:
- type: git pull

- // this command will tell you if you either have the newest version or download the newest one for you.
- the new software will then appear in the folder you are in.

=> Every time you do this, make sure that the paths are set correctly
	on Joh's computer they are different than on Yidi's
	
	Both paths are in the jupyter notebooks
	
	e.g. this one means Joh's path is current, and Yidi's is commented out (using '#' character)
	#pathOfTheYeastTrackAnalysisFolder = '/Users/sun.hong/Desktop/YeastTrackAnalysis-master/'
	pathOfTheYeastTrackAnalysisFolder = '/Users/johannesschoeneberg/git/DrubinBarnes/YeastTrackAnalysis/'
	
	change it to Yidi's computer by flipping the '#' character, e.g. to:
	pathOfTheYeastTrackAnalysisFolder = '/Users/sun.hong/Desktop/YeastTrackAnalysis-master/'
	#pathOfTheYeastTrackAnalysisFolder = '/Users/johannesschoeneberg/git/DrubinBarnes/YeastTrackAnalysis/'


	You have to do this in two places.
